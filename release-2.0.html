<h1>PhantomJS 2.1 Release Notes</h1>

<p>PhantomJS 2.0 was released on January 23, 2015. It came with an updated WebKit library based on Qt 5.3.</p>
        
<p><strong>Note 1:</strong> PhantomJS 2.0 is the first release in the 2.x. It has several
regressions compared to the previous 1.9 release.</p>

<p><strong>Note 2:</strong> This release note will be updated with more information in the coming days/weeks.</p>

<p><strong>Updated Qt and WebKit</strong></p>

<p>This release, and the upcoming 2.x series, is different that PhantomJS
1.x since it switches the core implementation to use <a href="http://qt-project.org/doc/qt-5.0/qtdoc/qt5-intro.html">Qt 5</a>
to get a more modern base platform, as well as to have an updated WebKit module.</p>

<p><strong>Removal of CoffeeScript support</strong></p>

<p>PhantomJS 2 can not run scripts written in CoffeeScript anymore
(see issue <a href="https://github.com/ariya/phantomjs/issues/12410">12410</a>).
As a workaround, CoffeeScript users can still compile their scripts to
JavaScript first before executing it with PhantomJS.</p>
