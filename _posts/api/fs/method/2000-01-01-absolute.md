'absolute(string)' (string)

Gets the absolute path to where the phantomjs is been run from.
If you use relitive addresses then you can get the actual address of directorys above and below the phantomjs program.

## Examples

```javascript
var fs = require('fs');
var res = fs.absolute("../");
console.log(res);
// This gives you the path of one directory up from the location in which the phantomjs is running.
var res = fs.absolute("/below");
console.log(res);
// This gives you the path of the below directory inside the location in which the phantomjs is running.
```
