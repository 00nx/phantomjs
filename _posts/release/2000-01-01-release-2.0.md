PhantomJS 2.0 was released on January 23, 2015. It came with an updated WebKit library
based on Qt 5.3.

**Note 1:** PhantomJS 2.0 is the first release in the 2.x. It has several
regressions compared to the previous 1.9 release.

**Note 2:** This release note will be updated with more information in the coming days/weeks.

**Updated Qt and WebKit**

This release, and the upcoming 2.x series, is different that PhantomJS
1.x since it switches the core implementation to use [Qt 5](http://qt-project.org/doc/qt-5.0/qtdoc/qt5-intro.html)
to get a more modern base platform, as well as to have an updated WebKit module.

**Removal of CoffeeScript support**

PhantomJS 2 can not run scripts written in CoffeeScript anymore
(see issue [12410](https://github.com/ariya/phantomjs/issues/12410)).
As a workaround, CoffeeScript users can still compile their scripts to
JavaScript first before executing it with PhantomJS.
