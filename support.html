<p>Note that PhantomJS is an open-source project run completely by <strong>volunteers</strong>. Nobody is paid to provide support and the existing maintenance capacity is already <strong>very limited</strong> (<a href="https://github.com/ariya/phantomjs/issues/14541">more details</a>). If nobody offers a possible solution to your problem, consider paying/hiring/contracting a professional software consultant.</p>

<p>Please <em>refrain</em> from from contacting each individual on the development team and asking for their help <em>directly</em>. These individuals already volunteer a considerate amount of their own time, effort, and money on this project. The least we could do is to let them enjoy their remaining spare time with their family and personal life.</p>
